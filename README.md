## About

I am a professional software developer who has always wanted to create and release a complete video game. In this personal project, I hope to program all gameplay, compose all music, and create all artwork.

For my game engine, I am using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) 3.X Mono (Lets me write `C#` instead of `GDScript`). For music, I am using [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) with mostly free virtual instruments. Digital artwork has not been started yet. I am using Linux in all steps of the process :).

## Backstory

The idea for this game came when I was hiking with friends in Alaska on a multi-use trail (we were on foot, but there were people on off-road vehicles like ATVs). When hiking, we encountered two black bears about 30 feet in front of us. We followed the correct protocols and slowly backed away. While anxiously waiting for the bears to leave, I heard the faint sound of an ATV in the distance coming towards us on the trail. In that heightened emotional state, my immediate thought was "\$\#\%\@\#, the bear commandeered an ATV and is coming for us". I became infatuated with that mental image of a 500 lb beast hurling towards me at 60 mph on a metal death machine. Who can stop that?
